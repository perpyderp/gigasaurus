    "name": "Gigantoraptor",
    "dossier": {
        "species": "Gigantoraptor nutritor",
        "time": "Late Cretaceous",
        "diet": "Omnivore",
        "temperament": "Territorial",
        "wild": "Unless you're planning to raid its nest, you shouldn't let this creatures imposing size worry you. Gigantoraptor may be fiercely protective of its brood, but it's much more a caregiver than a fighter.\nDon't get me wrong -- this theropod will use its sharp claws and surprising speed to defend its young when threatened. But Gigantoraptor has a soft heart for young ones -- it'll even take the orphaned babies of rival species.",
        "domesticated": "Now for the bad news: to my knowledge, no one's been able to figure out how to tame an adult Gigantoraptor -- its unique disposition seems resistant to behavioral conditioning. However, survivors bolder than me were able to sneak into nests to win the trust of their young, and they claim that reward is well worth the risk.\nOnce matured to adulthood, your tamed Gigantoraptor will happily look after any of your tribe's young creatures, nurturing them and teaching how to fight.\nIt can even use its call to help you find orphaned baby animals out in the wild. If you bring those orphans home, then your Gigantoraptor will happily add them to its brood."
