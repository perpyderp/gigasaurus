Active mostly when hunting for food or defending its nest, a good plan is to avoid every Tyrannosaurus. It is pure power -- from its stomp to its tail. It is not able to intimidate every foe with its roar, but upon hearing it, it might scare the poop out of you - quite literally. Despite being a different sub-species of Tyrannosaurus, everyone I've met still refers to them as a \"Rex\" or a \"T-Rex\". I've long since stopped trying to convince anyone, especially the few who I've encountered wearing Tyrannosaurus teeth as necklaces.",
        "domesticated": "Taming a Tyrannosaurus is without a doubt the goal for any warlord or warring tribe. Tyrannosaurus is a fierce battle companion. There is a reason Tyrannosaurus is considered the king of dinosaurs (or in this genus, the \"lord\"). Any tribe that manages to tame one has almost nothing to fear."
