        "wild": "Microluminis globulus is best described as a slobbering, roly-poly ball of affection. Just like its kin, it is completely harmless, despite its pronounced fangs. So if a survivor sees one running towards them, they should prepare to be licked, not bitten. Unfortunately, being so ugly that you're cute is not an effective means of self-defense, which lands it near the bottom of the food chain. Its Charge Light may intimidate some predators, but it attracts just as many.",
        "domesticated": "While Microluminis globulus has skin reminiscent of lizards or amphibians, its behavior is incredibly similar to a common canine. This has made it a particularly popular choice as a companion and source of Charge Light, but remember - whatever shoulder you rest it on will be covered in drool within minutes."
