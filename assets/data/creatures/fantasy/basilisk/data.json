        "wild": "More than twice the size of wild Titanoboa exonantur, Serpens regulus is the largest and most lethal snake I've encountered. With a skull that's more draconic than serpentine, it possesses a powerful bite, made even deadlier by the potent venom dripping from its fangs. The unique shape of its skull allows Serpens to hunt in a way that other snakes cannot: by burrowing. Once underground, it simply waits for its victims to approach. Fortunately its forked tail is usually still visible, poking just aboveground.",
        "domesticated": "Miraculously, survivors have not only managed to tame Serpens regulus, but ride it. Some can even stay seated while it lies in wait belowground, though I doubt it's a pleasant experience. While a wild Serpens can only be forced out of hiding by fire or explosives, once domesticated, it is easily trained to burrow or surface on command."
