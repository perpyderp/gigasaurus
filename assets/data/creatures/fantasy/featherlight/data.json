Even without the charged light it emits, it would give any modern bird on Earth a run for its money in terms of pure spectacle. Although its feathery eyebrows might give one of the impression that it is related to owls, it is not a bird of prey. It is entirely docile, and shows no aggression towards survivors or other creatures.",
        "domesticated": "Microluminis alectryon's ability to fly and the ease with which it perches upon a survivor's shoulder has made it a favored pet among many. Some consider it the most refined of its glowing brethren, but I think they just want to look like a pirate. Not that I blame them..."
