        "time": "Unknown",
        "diet": "Herbivore",
        "temperament": "Passive",
        "wild": "With a body reminiscent of a gecko, fluttery wings and a natural stockpile of charge light, Microluminis psykhe has an unearthly, if oddly charming appearance. A curious creature by nature, it always gave me the impression that it was studying me as much as I was studying it. A favorite snack of many predators, this small lizard has no natural poisons, or any means of defending itself at all save for a swift retreat and its charge light. Survivors can approach it without fear.",
        "domesticated": "As a pet, Microluminis psykhe is happy to clamber up a survivor's shoulder and cling to it as though it never wants to leave. Evenly tempered and easy to care for after being tamed, it is a stalwart companion and an excellent source of charge light."
