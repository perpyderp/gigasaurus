## Background

Gigasaurus is your Ark assistant, ranging from tracking tames to serving data of all things Ark related. I love Ark Survival Evolved, and I've come across the PokeAPI and thought it'd be a good idea to create something similar with Ark. This allows people to get Ark data at any time for whatever use it may be.

From this, it has given me practice on structuring data in a json format and experience with utilizing some of NextJs 14's features, such as catch all dynamic routing with catch all segments, which is what makes serving the data easy!
